## About


Following Overcharged is a userscript that provides a set of features improving the "follow" feature. Current version includes:
- Auto-following of questions (disabled by default)
- Auto-following of answers (disabled by default)
- "Unfollow all" feature to unfollow all posts

The userscript uses the [shared configurer](https://stackapps.com/q/9403/78873) for UserScripters projects as a peer dependency. Please install it if you want to be able to change the default settings.
This is how the configuration UI looks like:
