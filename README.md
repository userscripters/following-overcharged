Following Overcharged (inspired by a [MSE feature request](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/378980/786798)) is a userscript that provides a set of features improving the "follow" feature.

Current version includes:

| Feature                                        | Default  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Auto-follow of questions                       | disabled |
| Auto-follow of answers                         | disabled |
| Auto-follow posts on upvoting                  | disabled |
| Auto-follow posts on downvoting                | disabled |
| Auto-follow posts after editing (inline)       | disabled |
| 'Unfollow all' feature to unfollow all posts   | enabled  |

This is a "living" project, so the feature set is likely to be expanded upon in future versions.

The userscript uses the [shared configurer](https://stackapps.com/q/9403/78873) for UserScripters projects as a peer dependency.
Please install it if you want to be able to change the default settings.
This is how the configuration UI looks like:
